# ParsingResult
This is a library that provides simple parsing result types.

The library provides a set of types that can be used to represent
the result of a parsing operation. The types are designed to be
simple and easy to use, and to provide a consistent way to
represent the result of a parsing operation.

This library was designed to be used with the OmniEnvironment Platform project.
It can however be used in any project that requires simple parsing result types.
